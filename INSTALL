INSTALLING THE BINARY DISTRIBUTION

To install OBC on a linux system, first obtain and unpack the binary
tarball, which will have a name like obc-linux-i386-3.0.0.tgz.  Then type
the following shell commands:

	$ cd obc-linux-i386-3.0.0
	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ sudo make install

This will install the compiler and runtime system under /usr/local.
You can use e.g. './configure --prefix=/usr' to install it elsewhere.

The program Fac.m included in the distribution makes it easy to
perform a simple sanity test: just type the commands

	$ obc -o fac Fac.m
	$ ./fac 10

and check for the output

	The factorial of 10 is 3628800

The installation is now complete.
